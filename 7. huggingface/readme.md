# Huggingface

### In this Repo:

- We will get the open source models from the huggingface library
  - embedding (featureExtraction)
  - translation
  - translation with parameters
  - textToSpeech
  - question Answering
  - Text to image generation
- and use them for our projects using:
  - Huggingface APIs
  - By downloading models locally

#### 1.1 What is Huggingface?

- Huggingface is an opensource platform that provides a large Transformer library of pre-trained models for LLMs, Computer Vision, Audio models, Image models and more.

- The models are open source so they don't belong to any company (OpenAI, Google). Hence, a better choice where privacy and taking control in your hand is a priority.

- Hugging face also provides a platform to train your own models using datasets and share them with the community.

- It also has spaces where apps made by the community can be shared.

- Last but not the least, it also provides a platform to deploy your models.
